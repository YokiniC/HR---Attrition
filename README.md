## Project Structure:
- Data: Contains the raw data files used for analysis.
- Scripts: Includes any scripts or code used in the data transformation process.
- Visualizations: Stores the Power BI files and exported images of visualizations.

## Insights:
In order to come up with this visualization, I used Power Query Editor in Power Bi to initially transform unorganized data before creating this visualization. Then, Crafted a comprehensive correlation map for all numeric variables.
Explored intriguing insights related to Overtime, Marital Status, Job Role, Gender, Education Field, Department, Business Travel, and more.
Dived into the correlation between Overtime and Age, Total Working Years, Education Level, Number of Companies Worked, and Distance from Home.

## Key Learnings:
In this visualization, we could identify:

Salary Slab Distribution: A bar chart illustrates the distribution of employees across different salary slabs. This reveals the proportion of employees falling within each salary range, providing insight into the organization's compensation structure.

Total Attrition by Gender: A pie chart depicts the total attrition rate categorized by gender. This visualization allows for a quick comparison of attrition rates between male and female employees, highlighting any disparities or trends in employee retention.

Attrition Percentage Analysis: A line graph showcases the attrition percentage over a specific period, possibly by month or quarter. This enables tracking of attrition trends over time, identifying peak periods of employee turnover and potential underlying factors contributing to attrition.

Additional Insights: Further analysis could include identifying top-performing departments or teams based on attrition rates, using a bar chart. Additionally, examining attrition reasons or factors contributing to turnover through a stacked bar chart could provide a comprehensive understanding of the drivers behind attrition.

This visualization suite offers a comprehensive view of employee attrition patterns, enabling data-driven decision-making and targeted interventions to improve employee retention strategies.
